## Our Goal

Many e-commerce sites and online shops are facing the same software challenges. To resolve challenges like this, developers often try to invent their own solution to the same problem. What if we could pull our resources and ideas together? The result will be better software quality with even more features, and fewer bugs.

We connect developers and business owners to create software that solves common challenges for e-commerce sites. Developers can contribute their own ideas and learn from each other along the way. Every software project we create will be open-source and free to use without any charge.
