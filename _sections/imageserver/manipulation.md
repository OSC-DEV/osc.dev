You want to make changes to product images depending on the context where they are used? Tired of editing all possible versions for every single image in advance? Don't worry, we got you! Now you can edit product images on the fly simply by adding some url parameters. For example converting an image into grayscale is a easy as <code>/images/shirt.jpg?gray=1</code>. The Image Server currently supports rotate, flip, crop, grayscale, colorize, padding and overlay.
