Images have a high impact on your e-commerce success and your page load. A rough number comes from HTTP Archive, it shows that  more than 60 % of data load is caused by images. Luckily this critical element is at the same time a so called low hanging fruit. Mainly there are three techniques for optimizing images - resizing, manipulation and optimization. The results are load lighter, fewer and faster. Easy to change but with an significant effect on your loading time.
